ðŸ˜± Christmas can get expensive! 

You've been on a shopping trip and spent too much money. 
But how much of that can you blame on Christmas?

**Task**

- Calculate and return the total cost of only the gifts in the shopping cart.
- Each gift has the isGift boolean set to true.
- The total cost of gifts should be given to two decimal places.

Expected output: 559.93  

**Stretch Goal**

- Use the reduce() method to complete this challenge.

//Hint

- There are many ways to do this, but you could do it by iterating over the array, filtering out non-gifts, and totting up the prices of the gifts.

- Using the .reduce() method is probably the neatest way of solving this challenge. You might need to do some research to figure out how to get the sum of values in an object. Luckily, MDN has a section called "Sum of values in an object array" on their array.reduce() page. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce
