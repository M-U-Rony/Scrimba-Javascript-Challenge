Santa needs extra help in the run up to Christmas so he has created this advert with a form to allow elves and helpers to sign up.

In the small print, it says “we believe in equal opportunities”. But there is no evidence of that in this website because it has a ton of accessibility issues!

**Task**
Your task is to find and correct the accessibility issues. There are broadly four areas to think about. I have put details in hint.md but why not try to solve the issues without checking hint.md first!

You will need to change code in index.html and index.css to complete this challenge.


//Hint

- Think about the interactive elements. Do they have different states to help people interact with them?

- If someone were using assistive technologies, would they have all the info they needed about the different elements of the website like images and input fields?

- Is all of the text readable? There are many tools that can help you assess this, including ones built into browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Edge and Safari.

- Is any content likely to change as the user interacts with the site? If so, will the user be correctly notified of these changes if they are using assistive technologies?
