This Christmas, you’ve been tasked with running an anagram quiz at 
the family gathering.

You have been given a list of anagrams, but you suspect that some 
of the anagram pairs might be incorrect.

Your job is to write a JavaScript function to loop through the array
and filter out any pairs that aren’t actually anagrams.

For this challenge, spaces will be ignored, so "Be The Helm" would 
be considered a valid anagram of "Bethlehem".


//Hint

Try to rearrange the characters in the two strings in such a way
that you're able to compare the strings using the equality operator.
