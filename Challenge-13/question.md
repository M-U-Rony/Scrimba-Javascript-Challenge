Santa needs your help to figure out if he has enough money to give everyone change!
Your goal will be to return true if everyone gets their correct change, and false if at least one person does not receive their correct change! Use the function below to get started!

Good luck and happy coding!!

//Hint

Having trouble getting started?

Think about santas change problem as a set of conditonal statements (if, else if, etc). 
When santa delivers to someone and collects payment, what should you check each time? 
You will likely want to know how many of each bill you already have from collecting payment from others so you can determine if you have the correct bills to give change!
